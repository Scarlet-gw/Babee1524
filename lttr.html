                <p class = "body_txt"> People often say long-distance relationships do not work, but I do not believe that. Hearts pick people not places. <br> And it hurts that your place happens to be 242 miles away, but that does not lessen my feelings for you. <br> And yes, it is hard. I have never missed someone so profoundly without actually losing them, <br> and missing you is one of the hardest things I have ever endured. <br> I see other couples enjoying simple moments— goodbye kisses, falling asleep to the rhythm of a heartbeat close by— <br> instead of our whispered goodnights over the phone. <br> But it is all worth it the moment I run into your arms and feel at home again. <br> Being apart drives me crazy, but not being yours at all would be simply far worse. <br> So, I will keep fighting and loving you with everything I have, <br> because crossing state lines and enduring long train rides are small sacrifices <br> for the forever I can not wait to share with you.</p>
